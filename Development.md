Planning Database

Previously, the database looked like this. A few parts were unnecessary (the details table, days table) but the times section seemed overcomplicated. After a discussion with Mr. Copley, we identified the parts that needed changing and altered it to:

2 tables, the details and days tables, were removed. The details were integrated to the users section, as each user will have their one set of their own unique details (therefore there is no point having a second table to represent that). The days table was removed, as it functionally did nothing (you could represent each day with a single column as a number from 1-7). The times table was then altered to have a start time and end time, because having 24 columns for each time was clunky and overcomplicated, as well as inefficient.

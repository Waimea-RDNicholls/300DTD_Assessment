# Board/Card/Videogame Filter Search

This is my Level 3 NCEA project for Digital Technology.

It is a database-driven web app that allows users to find people who have similiar interests in any game type with them. It allows users to:
- Register an account
- Input what game they're looking for
- Search for people with similar preferences
- Filter by timezone, casual/competitive, etc
- Schedule for when to play

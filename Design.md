## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

<!-- Replace this text with a clearly stated problem or need that exists that your project will attempt to solve / fulfil. -->

It's hard to find people willing to play boardgames, cardgames or videogames just by looking around in person. Many of these games have niche audiences and small communities, often spread across the world. This means it's hard to find people to play with, but also to ensure you want to play with them, or have the time to. A casual gamer doesn't want to play with a competitive player. A player in New Zealand will struggle to play with a player in the United Kingdom, due to timezone differences. An app that allows you to search for people who want to play the same game as you, with a strong filtering system, solves this.

### End-User Requirements

<!-- Replace this text with a description of your typical end-users and their specific needs / expectations / requirements. -->

Competitive users: These users tend to want a more competitive style of game. They don't want to play with newer players and destroy them utterly and absolutely. They want good competition. They also want to be able to easily organise matches, with easy-to-use scheduling systems. These players tend to be willing to play at extreme hours, so they'll want to focus more on the skill level of players.

Casual users: These users want a more casual style of game. They don't want to get destroyed by some hyper-competitive player, they want to have fun and relax playing a game. They aren't going to be nearly as willing to play at 3 A.M. This means they'll want a good way to find players in the same timezone. Many may not even know that their game they're playing can be competitive, so an opt-in system to see competitive players may be wise. Finally, these players don't want to put up with "smurfs" (skilled players who intentionally sandbag so they can destroy weaker opponents) so some form of reporting would be key here.

Both these groups are incredibly diverse. They're filled with all sorts of people from all sorts of places, which means the app will need to focus on usability. Some of the users may not be very technologically literate. Note that many hyper-competitive players may also want the opposite, to have a very customizable interface that allows them to streamline their experience as much as possible. As these users are a tiny minority, they will not be the focus, but it is something to think about.

### Proposed Solution

Replace this text with a brief statement about the system that you intend to create, including the key functionality it should have.

I will create an app that allows the user to search through all other users to see who they can play their desired game with. Users will customize their profile to tell other people what they are interested in. The search system will allow users to sort by timezone, by game, etc. They will then be able to have some basic chats on the app to iron out any basic details, with users presumably being able to chat on other apps once they're all happy with each other. In case of toxicity, a method to report this to the administration will be available.
This app will need:
- Account registration
- Logging in feature
- User profile customization
- Some form of basic chat
- Strong search system
- Strong filtering options
- Reporting system???

## Relevant Implications

### Usability

<!-- Replace this text with a clear explanation of what the implication means. -->
Usability means making the app easy to use for all users, regardless of how technologically literate they are. This also means ensuring your website is usable for people with disabilities such as colour blindness, etc.

<!-- Replace this text with an explanation of why the implication is relevant to this particular project. -->
This is perhaps the most relevant implication as many boardgames are filled with people who aren't very technologically literate. The average age of a scrabble player is in the 50's, and older people tend towards being less literate technologically. Older people are also more likely to suffer from some form of disability that means they'll struggle to use apps that do not accomodate for that.
